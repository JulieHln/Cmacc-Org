=Clause 11

Ti=Sub-processing

1.sec={_the_data_importer} shall not subcontract any of its {_processing} operations performed on behalf of {_the_data_exporter} under the {_Clauses} without the prior written consent of {_the_data_exporter}. Where {_the_data_importer} subcontracts its obligations under the {_Clauses}, with the consent of {_the_data_exporter}, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the {_sub-processor} which imposes the same obligations on the {_sub-processor} as are imposed on {_the_data_importer} under the {_Clauses} (1). Where the {_sub-processor} fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement {_the_data_importer} shall remain fully liable to {_the_data_exporter} for the performance of the {_sub-processor}’s obligations under such agreement.

2.sec=The prior written contract between {_the_data_importer} and the {_sub-processor} shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in {_Clause} 3 for cases where the {_data_subject} is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of {_Clause} 6 against {_the_data_exporter} or {_the_data_importer} because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of {_the_data_exporter} or {_data_importer} by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the {_sub-processor} shall be limited to its own {_processing} operations under the {_Clauses}.

3.sec=The provisions relating to data protection aspects for sub-processing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which {_the_data_exporter} is established, namely {Exporter.Adr.Nation}.

4.sec={_The_data_exporter} shall keep a list of sub-processing agreements concluded under the {_Clauses} and notified by {_the_data_importer} pursuant to {_Clause} 5(j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to {_the_data_exporter}’s data protection {_supervisory_authority}.
